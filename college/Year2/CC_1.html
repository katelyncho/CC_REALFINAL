      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
      <p>
        My partner described her object 'It’s a blue fabric tea bag that hangs
        from a pink thread. Its materiality is soft yet rough to the touch. It
        was thin but squishy and had little density. Its blue fabric glistened
        yellow and silver in the light. Atop the front surface was a small frog,
        who’s gaze seemed comforting and learned. Although once pristine, his
        light green and blue had only slightly faded into the gray of use.'
      </p>
      <p>
        My interpretation was 'a lightblue triangle with few pink strokes on the
        top The base color is lightblue with some yellow and silver colors mixed
        In the middle of the triangle, there is a frog with a comforting face.
        Its color is lightgreen with blue and grey mixed.'
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, I started with filling the background. I wanted to give a
        sunlight effect, I gave a slight gradient of brown. Then I drew the main
        lightblue triangle. I wanted to use triangle(), but realized that I can
        not change the angle of the corner for triangle. Since I wanted the tea
        bag to have soft texture, I decided to use curve() instead. I had to
        overlap two triangles to create the shadow. On the tea bag, I gave
        texture and additional colors of the tea bag using ellipse and strokes
        with overlay.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the thread tied on the bag, I also used curve() to give gentle
        curves to the threads. The frog printed on the middle of the bag is made
        of ellipse() with translate() and rotate() to make the face. I used
        arc() for the eyes and curve() for the mouth in order to express the
        comforting emotion. Then I gave fading effect using some ellipse() of
        blue and lightgreen on the frog.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also wanted to make an animation of the tea bag swinging, but because
        I couldn't group the objects in p5js, I had to give up that part.
        Instead, I gave animation to the sunlight. I first created the light by
        drawing a big triangle with blendMode(Screen). Then I added an animation
        of changing the alpha channel percentage between 79 and 150.
