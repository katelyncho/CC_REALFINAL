      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
      <p>
        Break would mean different for everyone, and for me, it means going back
        home, which is 15hour flight away from here. As much as I like studying
        here, I also always want to go back home and see my family and friends.
        Therefore I made a clock that counts the d-day for break. I set the
        d-day as December 14th because that is when my flight is booked.
      </p>
      <p>
        My other two design ideas were tracking when I cook and do duolingo.
        However, because they were so irregular, I chose this clock. It was
        challenging for me discovering how to make the clock go backwards, which
        is opposite from normal clocks. I had some trials and errors that even
        made the whole website freeze whenever I run the code. However, I was
        able to figure out a better way to create same result. Through this
        project, I learned how to control the speed of the animation in the way
        I want it to look like.
      </p>
      <p>
        If i could do this project again, I would make the percentage bar in the
        shape of a plane and make it fly away when the percentage become 100%.
