      <h1>Pj 8. Portfolio Website</h1>

      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
      <p>
        This portfolio website includes my Critical Computation class
        assignments and one of my highschool artwokrk. I decorated the front
        page with the octopus painting I made in highschool since I used to use
        octopus a lot to symbolize my main theme and I thought it represents me
        well. I also tried to put some animations when hovering onto objects,
        and I made it work for the submenues. I also tried inserting artwork
        images in the selection boxes, however, it did not work well so I had to
        give up.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was my first time creating a website, and it took me much longer than
        I thought it would take. However, I was still able to learn a lot of new
        functions in html and css.
