      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, I created a data portrait of the music playlist I
        listened to for a week because I am a person who always have to be
        listening to something whenever I focus. I recorded what I listen to
        every time I played a music and categorized them into 6 big sections. My
        original plan was to make a one big circular sine wave divided into 6,
        however, I could not figure out how to make it. Therefore I had to
        change the plan. I created six different sine waves and partially
        covered them with arc. Each sine waves represent each category of the
        music genre, and they are cut by the percentage I listen to. As I wrote
        on the bottom left, the sine waves are divided into two big categories
        of lyrics and no lyrics by red and blue colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also added mouseIsPressed statement so that the text for the
        categories are not shown at first but appears when the mouse is pressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was able to enjoy the process of this project because it was my first
        time actually trying to calculate which music I listen most to. Even
        though my original plan did not work, I was able to understand better
        about sine wave in the process of trying to fix the problem.
