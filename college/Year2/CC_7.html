      <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
      <p>
        For this autobiographical game, I chose to make a game about the animals
        I took care of. When I was younger, I was very much interested in
        biology and animals, so I was in an afterschool biology class. Each
        class, they provided the students animals they can take care of if they
        wanted to. I have taken beetles, starfish, and snail from that class. I
        also had few goldfish and five hamsters because I got them from
        somewhere. And I have a cat now. When I was younger, before I met my
        cat, I thought I could be responsible about the animals I took home.
        However, now that I think back at that time, I was not. I guess I was
        just ignorant and innocent, but that does not justifies it. I made this
        game to remember all the animals and remind myself not to do the same
        thing ever again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used 640x360px size canvas for this game since the size of each
        character were drawn in 40x40px canvas, which is very small. The main
        character I chose is the character I made when I was young, which
        represents my childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it is shown in the introduction page, the game starts when the
        spacebar is pressed and the character moves with arrow keys. The base of
        this game is a snake game, therefore the main character has to collect
        all the animals and arrive to the exit safely with all the animals
        following at the back. The game starts from the right side and continues
        to the left, and it is because this game is about looking back into the
        past.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first stage represents me following my track of memory. Therefore
        the animals are placed in chronological order from recent to past. It is
        also why the characters sitting in the maze starts from me today, my cat
        I have now, and younger version of me. Furthermore, the background
        changes from New York to Seoul, because everything happened back in
        Korea. The character resets its location every time it collides to the
        wall or the canvas border.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the main character hits the exit, it moves on to the second stage.
        The second stage is based on a frogger game, therefore the main
        character has to avoid all the objects coming and arrive to the exit.
        Each objects represents some of the death of the animals I took care of.
        Every time the character bumps into an object or the canvas border, the
        location resets and loses one animal at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game ends and the ending scene displays when the main character
        arrives to the exit. Depending on the animals left, the ending scene
        changes. When all the animals arrives safely, the main character smiles.
        However, the face and the background gets darker as the character loses
        one animal, and eventually when it loses all animals and arrives alone,
        it cries.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoyed the process of making this game. However, it took me much more
        time to figure out how to make it work and debug the errors, which made
        me so stressful to make it done in short amount of time. I am so glad
        that I was eventually able to actually make this game work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I can continue on developing this game, I will first work on flipping
        the characters when the direction changes since it was bothering me a
        lot. I was trying to do it by adjusting the scale, but somehow it was
        not working. I should study it more. Also, I would like to adjust slight
        details of every part of the game, such as making resetting location
        more natural and spawning the objects only in certain area. I also want
        to add animation to the intro page and insert some music into the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, it is true that is was a very stressful project, but I was also
        able to enjoy and learn so much about game making. Therefore I think it
        was a pretty much successful project. :D
